# mst3k-data-explorer

Just a fun little HTML app to explore data around MSTK riffed movies.

Click on this [Home Page](https://jconallen.github.io/mst3k-data-explorer/) link and you will see the home page
of my explorer of MST3K movie connections.  It includes an interactive graph showing the connections between riffed
movies based on cast and crew.

### Credits

Graph uses the [vis-network](https://github.com/visjs/vis-network) JavaScript library.

The charts rely on [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org)
