        <h1>The MST3K Data Explorer</h1>
        <p>
            I am a big fan of the show Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K). I notice a lot of actors 
            in the riffed movies showing up time and time again. Also as someone interested in numbers
            and computer programming, I decided to investigate this a little further. Using the IMDB API,
            I have collected data on the full staff from all of the orginal run (1988-1999), including 
            the KTMA years and the movie.  With this data I have determine that five actors have appeared
            in five different riffed movies.  I created a data driven web page that displays the 
            <a href="involvement.html">involvement of all the actors, directors and writers</a> who 
            have been involved with at least to separate riffed movies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most interesting aspect of this project is when you take a step back and try to look
            at is holistically.  Being a computer science nerd, I think of this as a simple 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)" target="_blank">graph</a>,
            where the verticies are the riffed movies, and the edges represent an actor, director or writer
            that was involved in both of the connected verticies.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can <a href="movie_graph.html">explore this graph yourself</a>, and zoom in or out and tug 
            and pull on the verticies to get a better feel for the graph.  The graph takes some time to 
            load, so be patient, there is a lot of data being organized and layed out.
        </p>

            While this representation is simple enough, I was also interedted in seeing just who was 
            the connection between the two movies.  So in another for of the graph I added the crew 
            member that worked on both movies as a vertex (visualized in a different color and shape), 
            with the edge being the connection between the crew member and the movie they were involved 
            with. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can <a href="movie_crew_graph.html">explore this version of graph as well</a>.  This graph 
            takes even longer to load (since in now has separate verticies for the connecting crew members.
            So be patient.
