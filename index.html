        <h1>The MST3K Data Explorer</h1>
        <p>
            I am a big fan of the show Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K). I notice a lot of actors 
            in the riffed movies showing up time and time again. I am also someone interested in numbers
            and computer science. So I decided to have a little fun and code up some visualizations, and calculate
            some stats. Using the IMDB API, pulled the full staff data from all of the orginal run (1988-1999) MST3K
            episodes; including the KTMA years and the movie.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I created a data driven web page that displays the 
            <a href="involvement.html">involvement of all the actors, directors and writers</a> who 
            have been involved with at least to separate riffed movies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most interesting aspect of this project is when you take a step back and try to look
            at is holistically.  Being a computer science nerd, I think of this as a simple 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)" target="_blank">graph</a>,
            where the verticies are the riffed movies, and the edges represent an actor, director or writer
            that was involved in both of the connected verticies.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can <a href="movie_graph.html">explore this graph yourself</a>, and zoom in or out and tug 
            and pull on the verticies to get a better feel for the graph.  The graph takes some time to 
            load, so be patient, there is a lot of data being organized and layed out.
        </p>

        <p>
            While this representation is simple enough, I was also interedted in seeing just who was 
            the connection between the two movies. As it turns out this graph is so big that it is not practically 
            possible with normal browsers.  So, I made it interactive. From the "Involvement" page, there is a button
            on the crew member detail page that will bring you to a new blank graph, and seed that graph with 
            a node for the selected crew member.  From there you can expand the graph one crew member at a time.
            Think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers">Bacon Number</a>.
